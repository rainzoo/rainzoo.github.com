				<p>He tilted his head to read RS100 on the tyre before getting
					on the bus. People waiting for buses looked very busy. Their intent
					gazes didn’t shorten the wait. Frowns and anxiety.</p>
				<p>He showed his ID to the driver. He was glad that he didn’t
					have to struggle like those that stood waiting. He sat on a window
					seat and put on his headphones, music was louder than the sunshine.</p>
				<p>He felt something at his feet. Something pulling his shoe
					laces. For an instant it felt as if a lace go stuck somewhere. He
					looked down two questions struck him at a time. First, why is one
					lace longer than the other? Second, what is a pup doing there?</p>
				<p>He beamed and hung his bag on a broken handle behind the
					seat. Gently, he picked the pup and placed it on his lap. The lady
					sitting next bent away. She suppressed a shout and asked to put it
					away. He never thought someone could be afraid of a little dog.
					When the lady insisted, he said, rather loudly, “You want me to
					throw it out of the window?” Embarrassed, he took off his
					headphones while the lady looked away.</p>
				<p>Traffic was heavy as usual. There was a truck standing next.
					Three boys were sitting in the truck bed eating biscuits. He opened
					the window and shouted, “Biscuits !”. Then he raised the puppy and
					took out some money from his pocket. One boy stepped on the
					tailgate and gave him a packet of biscuit. In return, he gave
					money.</p>
				<p>The lady watched and conveyed disgust as the puppy licked
					biscuit crumbs off his hand. He got up and stood in the aisle,
					holding the puppy. Then he wrapped one arm around a handrail.
					Everyone was looking at him. He had never seen so many people
					smiling in the bus. That too on their way to the office. Moreover,
					never had so many people smiled at him. He had their attention. In
					fact, it had their attention. Many stroked the puppy, taking turns,
					without saying a word. Some started talking about their pets.
					Usually, few people talk to each other in the bus. The driver
					looked through the rear view mirror. He saw the driver also had a
					smile. The center of attraction was fed some biscuits, this time
					dipped in water.</p>
				<p>He looked through the large windows. He noticed new
					buildings, lots of giant billboards. He caught spelling mistakes.
					An all time favorite. It reminded him of the summer at grandma’s
					house. His father misspelled “business”. On being corrected he
					disagreed. Without Internet or even a dictionary, it was hard to
					prove. After a couple of days, his father admitted his mistake.
					They both felt happy and proud. Doing something right makes you
					happy. Today, his legs won’t give up, those arms know no pain. He
					didn’t even dislike the lady anymore.</p>
				<p>Before they reached the bus bay, he got down. He placed the
					puppy and biscuits on a sidewalk. He walked toward the bus bay. As
					soon as he reached the floor, he went to the restroom and washed
					his hands. He washed repeatedly and vigorously. His fingers could
					feel the puppy’s forehead. At each stroke, it would close its eyes.
					When he would stop, it looked up.</p>
				<p>It was one lousy soap.</p>
