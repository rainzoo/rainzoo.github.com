				<p>Let me tell you a story of an aquarium. Each fish there was
					like a goldfish, in a tiny glass bowl of its own, afraid of an
					unseen cat prowling outside. Swimming in circles they chased an
					illusive change. But change is not a thing that can be found. It is
					a realization not a choice. There was, however, one fish which
					would often stare through the glass. One day, it swam to the
					surface and with all its might, jumped out. Bubbles rise to the
					surface of water and disappear. Fishes don’t chase them. They are
					hope.</p>
				<p>Gasping for breathe as it fell back, it thought, “this is
					water.” It learned that there is something beyond the aquarium.
					Fishes don’t have a word for water. It continued to make higher,
					longer jumps. It was scared whether this effort will succeed.
					Burdened by the fear of regret that might come in the future, it
					had failed to realized that those tiny fins were getting stronger.
					They were taking another shape. It was the ten thousandth attempt,
					when it could stay in air and not fall. It fluttered its fins as
					hard as it was to breathe air. You wouldn’t know if you’re flying .
					It had grown wings. Next morning, filled with nothing but
					amazement, it spread its nascent wings and soared high. Most fishes
					swam by, some wondered how a bird could have lived among them this
					long. Others said they knew this one was different. They said the
					way it looked at the glass, they knew it would do something new.</p>
				<p>The fish glanced down. In the grand scheme of things, the
					aquarium was tiny. The wind was cruel and sun was astonished. Once
					over the clouds, it shook off water. Then, like a habit, it shook
					again. There was no water now. Even if an aquarium is flying up in
					the air, for a fish inside it, there is no way to know it.</p>
